As I sit down to write this blog post for the first time on my third website, I can’t help but reminisce about the evolution of my online presence. From my humble beginnings with a simple AI-generated design to the more sophisticated platform I have today, each iteration has taught me valuable lessons about aesthetics, user experience, and the importance of content.\nThe First Website: A Bold Beginning\nMy journey began with my first website, a creation that was both exciting and experimental. Built using AI and HTML, it featured a striking background image of a mountain in Antarctica. The choice of this image was intentional; I wanted to convey a sense of adventure and exploration. The text was rendered in a vibrant light/neon green, which not only stood out against the icy backdrop but also gave the site a modern, tech-savvy feel.\nThe content was housed in a container bubble, a design choice that added a playful touch to the overall aesthetic. While the site was far from perfect, it was a bold statement of my aspirations and creativity. It was a space where I could express myself and share my thoughts, albeit in a somewhat chaotic manner.\nThe Second Website: A Lesson in Simplicity\nAfter some time, I decided it was time for a change. My second website was a stark contrast to the first. I opted for a minimalist design, which, in hindsight, may have been a bit too simplistic. The monospaced font gave it a utilitarian feel, and the overall layout felt more like a digital resume than a personal website. I included a CV page, thinking it would be a great way to showcase my skills and experiences. However, the lack of personality and visual interest made it feel boring and uninspired.\nThis phase taught me an important lesson: while simplicity can be effective, it should not come at the cost of creativity and engagement. I realized that a website should not only serve as a portfolio but also as a reflection of who I am and what I stand for.\nThe Third Website: A New Chapter\nNow, as I write this blog post on my third website, I feel a renewed sense of purpose and excitement. This iteration combines the lessons learned from both previous versions. The design is vibrant and engaging, yet it maintains a level of professionalism that reflects my growth. I’ve incorporated elements that resonate with my personality, while also ensuring that the user experience is seamless and enjoyable.\nThis website is not just a platform for showcasing my work; it’s a space for storytelling, sharing ideas, and connecting with others. The blog section is a new addition, and I’m thrilled to finally be writing content that reflects my thoughts and experiences. I envision this blog as a place where I can explore various topics, share insights, and engage with my audience in meaningful ways.\n","path":null},{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/","title":"Home","description":null,"body":"\n\nHello, World!\nHi, My name is Doruk or (Derek if its hard to pronounce) I am a 14 year old developer who lives in Europe.\nWhen I was 4 or 5, I remember looking inside of PCBs inside of clocks, toys and some cheap-ass bluetooth headphones. My coding adventure started at when I was 7, I was about to learn JavaScript but that did not come to the reality. So instead of it I started learning when I was 8, then when I was 10 to 11, I learnt Java, and it did not go well because I never thought that Java was easy and I did not practice it. When I was 12, I learned Bash, HTML and CSS. And finally, When I was 13, I learned React, JS, Vue, Next.js and Python.\n\nI love taking pictures of my cats!\n\n\nIn addition to coding, I have several hobbies that I enjoy. I love studying and constantly seek to learn new things. Playing basketball is another passion of mine; I enjoy the competition and teamwork involved. I also play the piano and guitar, which allows me to express myself through music. Tennis is another sport I enjoy, as it keeps me active and focused. Lastly, I have a love for photography, capturing moments and exploring the world through my camera. These hobbies complement my coding journey and keep me engaged in various ways.\n","path":null}]
