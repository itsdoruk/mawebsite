# **Hello, World!**

Hi, My name is Doruk or (Derek if its hard to pronounce) I am a <span class="spoiler">14</span> year old developer who lives in Europe.


When I was 4 or 5, I remember looking inside of PCBs inside of clocks, toys and some cheap-ass bluetooth headphones. My coding adventure started at when I was 7, I was about to learn JavaScript but that did not come to the reality. So instead of it I started learning when I was 8, then when I was 10 to 11, I learnt Java, and it did not go well because I never thought that Java was easy and I did not practice it. When I was 12, I learned Bash, HTML and CSS. And finally, When I was 13, I learned React, JS, Vue, Next.js and Python.

In addition to coding, I have several hobbies that I enjoy. I love studying and constantly seek to learn new things. Playing basketball is another passion of mine; I enjoy the competition and teamwork involved. I also play the piano and guitar, which allows me to express myself through music. Tennis is another sport I enjoy, as it keeps me active and focused. Lastly, I have a love for photography, capturing moments and exploring the world through my camera. These hobbies complement my coding journey and keep me engaged in various ways.
